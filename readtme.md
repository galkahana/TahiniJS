WIP, and don't get your hopes too high.
Im considering a JS port of HummusJS, as an alternative to HummusJS, and possible webassembly.
It's a lot of work and im not 100% its worth it, HummusJS being quite alright, and have developed a cloud service around it (it's currently private). so it's just a little passtime for now.
